## Code Organization

- **Source Files Location**: All source files, including `.cpp` `.hpp` `.tpp` and `.h` files, must be placed inside the `src` directory. This helps maintain a clean and organized codebase.

## Coding Standards

- **Function Naming**: All functions must use snake_case naming. For example, a function that calculates the average should be named `calculate_average()`, not `CalculateAverage` or `calculateAverage`.
  
- **Class Naming**: Class names should follow CamelCase naming conventions. For instance, use `MyBigClass` instead of `my_big_class` or `Mybigclass`.

- **Variable Naming**: Choose descriptive and meaningful names for variables, use snake_case. Avoid using abbreviated or simplified names such as `num`, `msr`, etc. The goal is for the code to be self-explanatory, improving readability and maintainability.

## Commenting and Documentation

- While we strive for self-explanatory code through clear naming conventions and structure, please document complex logic or algorithms that may not be immediately obvious to others. Use comments to explain the "why" behind non-trivial solutions or decisions.
